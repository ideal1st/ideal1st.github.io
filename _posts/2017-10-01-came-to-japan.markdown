Dear kids,
```ね、みんな。```

This is your dad speaking.
```お父さんですよ。```

How's life going?
```人生はどう？```

I hope everything's going fine for you.
```全部は大丈夫だと毎日祈っていたよ。```

I'd like to tell you about that certain time I left you guys for Japan.
```君達とさようならにして日本に来たあの日についてなんか言いたいと思った。```

You might have forgot because you guys are still very young back then.

The first time I arrived in Kansai International Airport (KIX; don't ask me about the X) I was so happy.

It was a dream come true.

As soon as I got to leave the boring administrative routine, I rushed to the praying space.

I thank our god, Allah, for the huge blessing I received that day.

I might have left you, my beloved kids, but I fully believe it was for the better.

I already had plans on how to get you guys to live with me in Japan anyway.

So, I entrusted you with Allah.

I love and trust Allah so much.

And I want you guys to love and trust Him even more than I could ever do my whole lifetime.

I sincerely wish so for you.

Love,

Dad
